### **2. Text Extraction and Cleanup**

- Extract text from the URL's HTML.
- Clean up the extracted text to remove any unwanted characters or formatting.

### **3. Text Chunking and Summarization**

- Chunk the text into paragraphs.
    - For each paragraph:
        - Summarize into one sentence.
- Chunk each paragraph into sentences.
    - For each sentence:
        - Summarize into its shortest form.

### **4. Storing**

- Store summarized texts.
    - If the summarized text is not present on the knowledge graph, store it as a new node.
